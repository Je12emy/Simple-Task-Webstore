# Preface

* **Context:** In Value Lab's Costa Rica office there has been a low conversion and retention rate of both engineers and administrative staff on Imagine's AiDE Platform.
* **Goal:** Develop an educational program for new adopters of AiDE.
* **Strategy:** 
	* Develop a knowledge repository made by users for users catered towards members of Costa Rica's office, in help induct them into Image's AiDE Platform through the creation of.
		* Written interactive articles similar to what you would encounter in developer documentation web sites.
		* Video guides.
	* Make the educational material easy to access for students.
* **Success Metrics:**
	* Office wide impact of AiDE is increased to at least 20% once the program goes live and into production on the first quarter.
	* AiDE's ACE Certification program success rate increases to at least 70%.

> [!NOTE]
> Usage is measured based on Value Lab's internal metrics, which is theorized as the total sum of `actual efforts`. The goal of 20 % is based on VL's last internal goal for the last performance review where this percentage was established company wide.

# Learning Material

Every member of Value Labs should be given the same importance when writing educational material for. Thus we should educate both administrative staff and engineers on ways they could leverage the capabilities of Imagine's AI tools and the value they can provide for customers. 

Material should be written to address possible cases of adoption, conforming possible needs. While these are general use cases, we should be open towards identifying blockages in adoption and work towards proposing a possible workflow to integrate AiDE into.

Here is an outline of topics that could be covered in any form.
* [AIDE vs Chat GPT - What's the Difference?](Learning%20Material/AIDE%20vs%20Chat%20GPT%20-%20What's%20the%20Difference?.md)
	* Corporate usage.
	* Data protection and compliance.
* [What is an agent?](Learning%20Material/Introduction%20to%20Agents.md)
	* Differences between models.
	* Capabilities.
* [I'm not a developer, how do I use AiDE Agent?](Learning%20Material/Non-developer%20guide%20to%20AIDE%20Agent.md)
	* Developer environment set-up.
		* Plugin installation.
		* Requesting a token.
		* Plugin configuration.
	* Automating the boring stuff.
	* Identifying possible use cases.
	* What are "tokens"?.
* [Prompt engineering best practices: How do I get the best possible results when prompting?](Learning%20Material/Prompting%20Basics.md)]

Value Labs has recently established a mandatory certification for engineering staff, this certificate is meant to vet an engineer's base line knowledge of AI tools. In Costa Rica's office, approval rate is low, thus the original inspiration towards beginning this program.

* [ACE Certification Study Guide](Learning%20Material/ACE%20Certification%20Study%20Guide.md).
	* Showcasing your agent knowledge.
		* Let's update our web shop.
			* Agent modes.
			* Checkpoints.
	* Tips and best practices for your system test.

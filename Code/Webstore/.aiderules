# AiDE Rules for Simple Web Store

## Project Intelligence

- **Framework:** Python Flask
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Key Pattern:** Separation of concerns is important. Database logic should be abstracted away from the main application file.

## User Preferences

- The user prefers a clear, well-documented project structure. Memento files are critical and must be kept up-to-date.

## Workflow

1.  **Plan:** Always start by reviewing the Memento files to understand the project state.
2.  **Act:**
    - Implement features according to the `activeContext.md`.
    - Update Memento files after significant changes, especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`.
    - Document new patterns or decisions in `.aiderules`.
3.  **Verify:** After implementation, provide `curl` commands or other simple ways to verify the functionality.

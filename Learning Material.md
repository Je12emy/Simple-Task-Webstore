Every member of Value Labs should be given the same importance when writing educational material for. Thus we should educate both administrative staff and engineers on ways they could leverage the capabilities of Imagine's AI tools and the value they can provide for customers. 

Material should be written to address possible cases of adoption, conforming possible needs. While these are general use cases, we should be open towards identifying blockages in adoption and work towards proposing a possible workflow to integrate AiDE into.

Here is an outline of topics that could be covered in any form.
* How different is AiDE from Chat GPT?
	* Corporate usage.
	* Data protection and compliance.
* What is an agent?
	* Differences between models.
	* Capabilities.
	* What are "tokens"?.
* I'm not a developer, how do I use AiDE Agent?
	* Developer environment set-up.
		* Plugin installation.
		* Requesting a token.
		* Plugin configuration.
	* Automating the boring stuff.
	* Identifying possible use cases.
* Prompt engineering best practices: How do I get the best possible results when prompting?

Value Labs has recently established a mandatory certification for engineering staff, this certificate is meant to vet an engineer's base line knowledge of AI tools. In Costa Rica's office, approval rate is low, thus the original inspiration towards beginning this program.

* ACE Certification for Engineers.
	* Showcasing your agent knowledge.
		* Let's update our web shop.
			* Agent modes.
			* Checkpoints.
	* Tips and best practices for your system test.
